/**
The fx-CG has a large number of characters it must be able to represent internally. Because of this the fx-CG supports multi-byte character strings.
To differentiate a single byte character from a multi-byte character, a multi-byte character's first byte is always an extended code. Extended codes are 0x7F, 0x7, 0xF9, OxES, OxE6 and OxE7. Currently only four codes are used:
0x7F, 0xF9, 0xES and OxE6.
