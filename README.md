# fx-CG SDK for Xcode
The macOS Installer constructs the SDK for developing Add-Ins for the Casio FX-CG (Prizm) color graphing calculator. It provides an Xcode project along with sample examples to facilitate the beginning of development. One can test their Add-Ins on macOS to a certain extent before deploying them to an actual FX-CG (Prizm) color graphing calculator.

You'll also find a pre-built SDK for macOS in the SDK folder under macOS. Just unzip the zip file within the CASIO folder in your Applications directory. If you don't have a CASIO folder, create one, and then unzip the contents into it. Afterward, you'll have an SDK folder within your CASIO folder, which is located in your Applications directory.
